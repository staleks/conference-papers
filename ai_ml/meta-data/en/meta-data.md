## Presentation abstract

_We will delve into the enigmatic world of artificial intelligence to demystify the myths and misconceptions that often cloud its understanding. We’ll explore how Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT function, utilizing vast amounts of data and sophisticated algorithms to generate human-like text. We will also discuss the broader category of Generative AI, which includes technologies that can create content ranging from text to images and music, illustrating the capabilities and potential of these systems. To further illustrate the versatility of AI, we will delve into the Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, which combines the strengths of information retrieval with generative models to enhance answer accuracy and relevance. Examples of RAG in action include its use in enhancing search engine responses and improving interactive educational tools, demonstrating its practical applications across various industries. This comprehensive exploration will provide a solid foundation for understanding the current landscape and future potential of AI technologies._
