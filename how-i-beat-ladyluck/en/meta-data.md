## Presentation abstract

_Most of us as software developers have something called a "Main Job", which we do to earn money, provide for our family, take care of our needs. In many cases, the main job may not be according to our desire and control. So what happens to passion and desire to learn something new? That's where a “Side Project” comes in. A “Side Project” is something you do in addition to your main job to fuel your passion to learn something new. It has several benefits such as: living your passion, learning new skills, potential for growth, boosting your mental health, etc. The goal of this presentation is to show what you can do in four, five evenings and enrich your experience. The idea came while I was watching the Eurovision Song Contest with my friends. I wanted to be ahead by knowing who the favourites and possible winners are. The presentation will answer some questions such as: what was the trigger, how to develop your idea, what is needed to make it happen and finally the conclusion._
